# Orion
My attempt at a somewhat decent Discord bot written in discord.py

## Installation
Details for installing given below is for macOS. You can use whatever the equivalent method is if you're using a different OS.

- First open the terminal. If incase you don't know how to open one - Press `Command` + `Space Bar` on your Mac Keyboard and enter `Terminal`    

- After navigating to the directory of your choice run       
    ```  
    git clone https://github.com/Zeus432/Orion     
    ```

- Then make sure to install all the required python packages by running      
    ```  
    python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt     
    ```

- Then edit the name of the `configsample.json` file to `config.json` and fill out the necessary details, like the bot token etc.

And thats it, if you've done all that then you're set to start running your own version of Orion!     

Now to actually run the bot do:     
```
python3 .
```
